[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)
>> The difference in the mean weights of first born baies and other babies, calculated as firsts.totalwgt_lb.mean() - others.totalwgt_lb.mean()is -0.125. And absolute Cohen's d of thr total weight between the first babies group and other babies groups is 0.089 which is less than 0.2 thus very small. From these calucation we can conclude the first babies are lighter than other babies but from the Cohen's d value we conclude the the effect is small.

>> Comparing the 'Effect size' for variables pregnency length and birth weight between the babies in first born group to other babies group: birth weight differs more than the pregnancy length.
